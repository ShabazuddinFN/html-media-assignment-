DOCTYPE:
The Document Type Declaration, often abbreviated as DOCTYPE, 
is an instruction that is used in HTML documents to specify the
version of HTML or XHTML being used. It is placed at the very 
beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag. The purpose
of the DOCTYPE declaration is to tell the browser or parser how to
interpret the document and to ensure that the document is rendered correctly.

The general syntax of the DOCTYPE declaration is as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>

In this example, html refers to the version of HTML being used.
In modern web development, the DOCTYPE for HTML5 is commonly used,
as shown above.
