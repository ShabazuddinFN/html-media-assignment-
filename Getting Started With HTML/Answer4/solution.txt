Tag:
In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), a "tag" is a fundamental building 
block used to structure and format content on the web. HTML tags are
used to define elements within a document, and they consist of opening
and closing tags that surround content.
HTML tags are essential for structuring web documents and providing 
meaning to different parts of the content. They help browsers and other 
web tools understand how to display and interpret the information on a 
webpage. There are various HTML tags, each serving a specific purpose,
such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.

Example for a Tag:
<p>This is a pragraph tag.</P>
In this example, <p> is the opening tag, and </p> is the closing tag.


Elements:
In the context of web development and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language),
an "element" refers to a fundamental part of an HTML document, marked 
by a set of tags that define its structure and content. An HTML element
typically consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. 
The combination of the opening and closing tags, along with the content 
they enclose, forms a complete element.


Example for a Element:-

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

In this example:

. <p> is the opening tag, indicating the start of a paragraph element.
. This is a paragraph. is the content of the paragraph.
. </p> is the closing tag, indicating the end of the paragraph element.
