                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard
                markup language used for creating web pages and web
                applications. With HTML, you can create structured documents by
                denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
                paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements
                are the building blocks of HTML pages, and are represented by
                tags written using angle brackets. An HTML document is made up
                of various HTML tags and attributes that define its structure
                and content, which web browsers then interpret to display web
                pages. HTML is a fundamental technology in the field of web
                development, and it is often used in conjunction with CSS
                (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create dynamic and
                visually appealing websites.

            <dd>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet
                language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone
                technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                CSS enables the separation of presentation and content,
                including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation improves
                content accessibility, provides more flexibility and control in
                the specification of presentation characteristics, enables
                multiple web pages to share formatting, and reduces complexity
                and repetition in the structural content.

            <dt>Java Script</dt>
            <dd>
                JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that
                is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside
                HTML and CSS. Originally developed by Netscape as a means to add
                dynamic and interactive elements to websites, JavaScript has
                grown to become a versatile and powerful language used in
                various applications, from client-side web development to
                server-side programming.

            <dt>MongoDB</dt>
            <dd>
                MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database. Unlike
                traditional relational databases, which use tables and rows,
                MongoDB is document-oriented. This means it manages data as
                "documents," which are structured as JSON-like (JavaScript
                Object Notation) formats with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls
                this format BSON, which stands for Binary JSON). This
                flexibility allows records to have different fields and
                structures, making MongoDB a versatile choice for managing
                complex and evolving data models.

                Express.js, often referred to simply as Express, is a popular
                web application framework for Node.js. It is designed to build
                web applications and APIs with ease and efficiency. As a minimal
                and flexible Node.js framework, Express provides a robust set of
                features to develop both web and mobile applications.

            <dd>
                React, also known as React.js or ReactJS, is an open-source
                JavaScript library used for building user interfaces,
                particularly for single-page applications. It's maintained by
                Facebook (Meta Platforms, Inc.) along with a community of
                individual developers and companies. React allows developers to
                create large web applications that can change data, without
                reloading the page. Its key feature is the ability to build
                reusable UI components, which makes it very efficient and a
                popular choice for developing dynamic, high-performance, and
                interactive web applications.

            <dd>
                Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript
                runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes
                JavaScript code outside a web browser. Initially released in
                2009 by Ryan Dahl, Node.js was developed to address the
                limitations of traditional web servers by using non-blocking and
                event-driven I/O (input/output). It's designed to build scalable
                network applications and has become a key part of modern web
                development, particularly in building real-time web
                applications.
